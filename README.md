   - Add these secrets (from your `.env` file):
     - `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
     - `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
     - `VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL`
     - `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
     - `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
     - `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
     - `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Under "Source", select **GitHub Actions**

3. **Deploy:**
   - Push to main/master branch
   - The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and deploy
   - Visit: `https://ifzalkola.github.io/festi-quiz-play/`

## 🔐 Firebase Security Rules

For production, update your Realtime Database rules:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "rooms": {
      "$roomId": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": true
      }
    },
    "players": {
      "$playerId": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": true
      }
    },
    "currentQuestions": {
      "$roomId": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": true
      }
    },
    "answers": {
      "$roomId": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** These are permissive rules for simplicity. In production, add proper authentication and authorization.
